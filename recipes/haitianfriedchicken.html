    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Haitian fried chicken recipe varies from American-style fried chicken but is just as good. If you are in a hurry, you can marinate the chicken for 30 minutes, but the longer you leave it, the better. You may sprinkle freshly squeezed lemon juice on top if you like.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds chicken legs</li>
        <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>Â½ white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, cloves separated and minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons seasoned salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ground thyme</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons whole cloves</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken legs, lemon juice, onion, garlic, seasoned salt, paprika, thyme, pepper, and cloves in a large bowl. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Fry chicken in batches until golden brown, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
